# Sound before capital

An addon that replaces the beep that sounds when reading capital letters with a sound that is much more pleasant.

I've been pissed off by this horrible high frequency beep for a very long time (several years), almost from the moment I heard it for the first time, and one day I decided to do something about it, the result was this addon.

The add-on does not need to be configured, nor does it have its own gestures (hot keys).

Simply install it and it will start working.
